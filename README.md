_See the readme file in the main branch for updated instructions and information._

## Instructions

This repository has folders for each of the lesson videos in the course. The folders are structured to correspond to the videos in the course. The naming convention is `CHAPTER#_MOVIE#`. As an example, the folder named `02_03` corresponds to the second chapter and the third video in that chapter.

Some folders will have a beginning and an end state. These are marked with the letters `b` for "beginning" and `e` for "end". The `b` folder contains the code as it is at the beginning of the movie. The `e` folder contains the code as it is at the end of the movie.

## Coding Challenges

Each chapter in this course contains two coding challenges. The challenges themselves are powered by CoderPad and appear in the video player as you progress through the course. For each challenge there is a solution video where the instructor walks through the solution.

### Coding challenge solutions

Stand-alone examples of solutions to each challenge are available in this repository. They are found under the `/solutions` folder following the same naming convention as above. As an example, a proposed solution for the first challenge in chapter 2 is named `/02_04_solution/solution.js`.
